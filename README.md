Week 1
This week you will utilize various variable and functions to develop the first functionality for the Employee Management System 
Project due in Week 5. For this assignment, write a Python script to allow users to enter the following string values: 
employeeName, employeeSSN*, employeePhone, employeeEmail, and employeeSalary.

*(employeeSSN = Employee Social Security Number. For example, 123121234)

Once you have entered your values, you should display it in the following format:

---------------------------- Mike Smith -----------------------------

SSN: 123123123

Phone: (111)222-3333

Email: mike@gmail.com

Salary: $6000

Week 2
This week you will develop the second functionality for the Employee Management System Project due in Week 5. For this assignment, 
you will continue to utilize various functions to employ the list data structure by writing a Python script to allow users to enter 
information for five employees at the same time.

Use a basic list structure to enhance Functionality 1 that you developed in Week 1. You should allow users to enter information for 
five employees at the same time, where the first employee information entry is saved in index [0] and the second entry is saved in 
index [1], and so on. You want to make sure to enforce the user to enter the following employee information: 
employeeName, employeeSSN, employeePhone, employeeEmail, employeeSalary. After the user finishes entering the last employee information, 
they should get a message to allow them to print specific employee information from the saved list. The user can enter values between 1 
and 5, where 1 will return the employee information saved in the list index [0], 2 will return the employee information saved in the list 
index [1] and so on. The printed result should be in the following format:

Mike Smith, 123123,(111)222-3333,mike@gmail.com,$6000

Week 3
For this assignment, you will

Utilize looping to make your Python script for Functionality 2 (developed in Week 2) to run constantly.
Separate Functionality 1 (developed in Week 1) into the following two functionalities:
Add Employee – this functionality will allow users to add new employee to the system.
View all Employees – this functionality will view all employees in the system.
Use global variables to develop a counter to keep track of the number of employees in the system. A good employee 
management system should always give brief information about the existing number of employees. This counter can be 
shown to the user when they run the script as the following message:
There are (3) employees in the system.
