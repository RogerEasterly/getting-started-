The head of the accounting department told you that the company’s annual profit is typically 19 percent 
of the company’s total sales. He has tasked you to write a simple Python program that will calculate 
and display the estimated profit amount from an annual amount of sale. In this coding assignment you 
will utilize what you learned while reviewing the required resources for Week 1. Your program will 
have to display a clear message to prompt the user to enter any amount of sale (Total Sale: $xxxxx), and 
it should calculate the estimated profit amount, and show the result in the following format:

Profit Amount: $xxxxxx
Once you have completed the program, take a screen shot of the completed functionality 
(including the input and the output) and save it in a Word document, along with the script.
